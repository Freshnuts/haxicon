I wrote this because I saw peeps on forums writing in unique ways so that the "feds"</br>
don't somehow catch up to them. For example, Tey cn eithre misple wrds, or th3y c@n @dd !nt3g3rs & symb0ls!

I figured, why not automate this process with your custom algorithms?</br>
Let's do, Python, with functions that are compartmentalized & can be easily modulated. Organized.

Let's Ask:</br>

1. Why would this be done?</br>
Boredom, Procrastination.</br>
It saves time typing it manually?

2. What could be beneficial?</br>
Standardization? A UNIVERSE HACKER LANGUAGE? For example, what if we all wrote THE EXACT SAME.</br>
Would that benefit the goal to achieve annonymity? Or have a program to randomize weekly, etc.</br>

3. Who is this for?</br>
Defintely not for script kiddies, nor for Super Elite Hackers, both of these usually don't have</br>
the sense of humor for this.</br>

4. Where is this project going?</br>
Up to you. </br>

5. When is this happening?</br>
If you're reading this, the time is now, your destiny awaits..</br>

I'll be creating an algorithm from Enlgish language, that turns everything you</br>
type into y0d@ h@ck talk. (i.e - moving subjects, predicates, adjectives, nouns, etc.,</br>
then places them into yoda talk order.) But, this is going to be a working process..</br>



PS- This is all for fun, but if it grows.. it's still for fun.</br>
